## üîê API Security

**Key Security Measures:**

* **Authentication & Authorization:**
  Using JWT or OAuth2 to ensure users can only access resources they are authorized for.
* **Input Validation:**
  Prevents injection attacks by sanitizing user inputs.
* **Rate Limiting:**
  Controls the number of API requests to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
* **Data Encryption:**
  Secures sensitive information (like passwords and payment data) both in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.

**Why It Matters:**
Security ensures user trust, protects financial transactions, and maintains the platform‚Äôs integrity by preventing unauthorized access.

Would you like me to make it **Markdown-optimized** (with headers, bullet points, emojis, and consistent formatting for GitHub display)?
That version would be copy-paste ready for your repository.
